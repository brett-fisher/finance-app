## üé® Customization

### Adding New Categories

Edit the category arrays in the respective form components:

-   `src/components/TransactionForm.tsx` - Transaction categories
-   `src/components/BillForm.tsx` - Bill types
-   `src/components/IncomeForm.tsx` - Income sources

### Styling Changes

The app uses Tailwind CSS. Modify styles in component files or extend the Tailwind configuration in `tailwind.config.js`.

### Data Storage

Currently uses localStorage. To migrate to a database:

1. Replace functions in `src/lib/storage.ts`
2. Add API routes for CRUD operations
3. Update components to handle async operations

## üß™ Testing

A comprehensive testing checklist is available in `TESTING_CHECKLIST.md`. Key areas to test:

-   ‚úÖ All CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
-   ‚úÖ Form validation and error handling
-   ‚úÖ Month navigation and data persistence
-   ‚úÖ Financial calculations and summaries
-   ‚úÖ Responsive design on all screen sizes
-   ‚úÖ Browser compatibility

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

-   **Multi-User Support**: Migrate to Supabase for user accounts
-   **Data Export**: Export data to CSV/PDF
-   **Bill Reminders**: Notifications for upcoming due dates
-   **Budget Planning**: Set monthly budgets by category
-   **Charts & Graphs**: Visual representation of financial data
-   **Recurring Transactions**: Automatic transaction templates

### Migration to Supabase

When ready for multi-user support:

1. Set up Supabase project
